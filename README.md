# Iris-flower-classification
# Overview
This project focuses on the classification of iris flowers using logistic regression. The Iris dataset, a classic machine learning dataset, is employed for training and testing the logistic regression model. The model aims to predict the species of iris flowers based on features such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

# Key Features
- Logistic Regression Model: Implements logistic regression for the classification task.
- Iris Dataset: Utilizes the well-known Iris dataset for training and evaluation.
- Feature Analysis: Explores the importance of sepal and petal features in predicting iris species.

# Dataset
The Iris dataset is included in the `data` directory. It consists of measurements for 150 iris flowers, with four features each.
# Results
The logistic regression model achieves accuracy in predicting iris flower species. Explore the results in the project's output and visualization.
